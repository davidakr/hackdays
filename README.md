# LufthanSTARS

LufthanSTARS is an Android AR application that lets you explore your place of destination. It shows prominent sights of the destination place and allows users to add comments.

The App enganges passengers to share their knowledge and connect with fellow passengers by rewarding LufthanSTARS for answering questions in our forums.

In this way, users connect to others, may find travel buddies and get answers to questions about their destination place.

We developed the application during Hackdays Rhein-Main 2019 and were not only awarded as the best team within Lufthansa's Challenge, but also won the overall best pitch.

The App is implemented with Android and ARCore and is connecting to a Flask backend that accesses a MongoDB.
