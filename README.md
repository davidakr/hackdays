# LufthanSTARS

LufthanSTARS is an Android AR application that lets passengers explore their place of destination and communicate with fellow passengers. It shows prominent sights of the destination place and allows users to add comments.

The App engages passengers to share their knowledge and connect with others. Besides the comments displayed next to the individual sights, users can ask and answer questions in the forums. In this way, users connect to others, may find travel buddies, and get answers to questions about their destination place.

The App rewards active discussions with LufthanSTARS, an in-app currency that can be traded for extra miles.

We developed the application during Hackdays Rhein-Main 2019 and were not only awarded as the best team within Lufthansa's challenge but also won the overall best pitch.

The App is implemented with Android and ARCore and is connecting to a Flask backend that accesses a MongoDB. Also, the application can be operated in planes' internal network and is not limited to an internet connection.

The shown demo was recorded in a Lufthansa flight to New York and shows the passenger its must-sees.
